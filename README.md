# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Used computer vision and machine learning to detect and recognize hand gestures in real-time using a webcam. Implemented the project with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. The system can identify different gestures to control applications or trigger actions, useful in sign language, touchless control, and interactive systems.
